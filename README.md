# SIGEVO     SUMMER     SCHOOL 2019

[SIGEvo](https://sigevo.org) Summer School 2019 in Prague, Czech Republic, back-to-back with
[GECCO 2019](http://gecco-2019.sigevo.org/). 

## Dates

July 10-12 (plus GECCO tutorials/workshops 13-14). It will take
place in the University of Prague the days before the conference, with
access to GECCO tutorials for those that have not registered for GECCO too.

## Description

SIGEVO is a special interest group of ACM always looking for new ways
to enlarge the community of researchers working in different
biologically inspired metaheuristics. The third SigEvo Summer School
(S3), held in conjunction with GECCO 2019 in Prague, is looking for
students.

The core of the second S3 will take place in Prague in the days
previous to the conference, and will continue with tutorials the two
first days of GECCO, although the bulk of the school will finish right
before GECCO. That way, students will be able
to enjoy and learn during the conference proper without the burden of
having to work on the S3 projects. GECCO tutorials and 
workshops will be an integral part of the S3. You
can [register now](http://www.cvent.com/d/66q2lw/4W) in the GECCO
registration site.


Students are expected to:

- Attend the three days of the summer school, as well as some
  tutorials and workshops the two first days of GECCO.

- Have a valid registration for the summer school. You can register
  independently (with free access to tutorials and workshops) or
  together with GECCO for a small additional fee.

- Cooperatively work on an assignment and follow the standards of
    proper social and research behavior.
	
- Deliver, by the end of S3, a paper and presentation on what they
  have been working on during it. 

Students of the S3 will be eligible for travel, register and lodging
grants of GECCO.

We specially encourage women and minorities to apply for this summer
school, where everyone is welcome.
